_Game Basics :Â _
2 players for a 1 vs 1 game mode.

Each player has a team of three characters.
Each character has health points, a name and a weapon.
The characters attack with a weapon.
It is the team that has to determine the damage the character is going to do.

A chest may appear in front of a character when the character takes his turn.
This chest will necessarily contain a weapon (more or less powerful than the existing one).
